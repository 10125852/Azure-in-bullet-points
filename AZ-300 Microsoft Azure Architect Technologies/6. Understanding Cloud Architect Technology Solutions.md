# Understanding Cloud Architect Technology Solutions

## Design and Connectivity Patterns

- [https://docs.microsoft.com/Azure/architecture/patterns/](https://docs.microsoft.com/Azure/architecture/patterns/)
- **Partitioning workloads**
  - Modularize application to functional units.
    - Each module
      - Handles portion of application's overall functionality
      - Represents set of related concerns.
    - Why?
      - Easier to design both current & future iterations of your application.
      - Modules can also be tested & distributed and otherwise verified in isolation.
- **Load balancing**
  - Application traffic or load is distributed among various endpoints by using algorithms.
  - Allows
    - Multiple instances of the website can be created
    - They can behave in a predictable manner
    - Flexibility to grow or shrink the number of instances in application without changing the expected behaviour
  - Load balancing strategy considerations
    - Physical vs Virtual Load balancers
      - Use Virtual Load Balancers (hosted in VM's) if company requires a very specific configuration.
    - Load balancing algorithm
      - round robin => Selects next instance for each request based on a predetermined order that includes all of the instances.
      - random choice
    - Configurations
      - Affinity/stickiness: If subsequent requests from the same client machine should be routed to the same service instance.
      - Required when application has state.
- **Transient fault handling**
  - Leads to more resilient applications.
  - Implemented in .NET lib's (entity framework, Azure SDK etc)
  - Transient errors=> occur due to temporary interruptions in the service or to excess latency.
  - Many are self-healing and can be resolved with retry policy
  - Retry policy
    - Retry when a temporary failure occurs.
    - A break in the circuit => abort retries if it's a serious issue.
- **Queues**
  - Provides a degree of consistency regardless of the behaviour of the modules.
  - Direct method invocation
    - Connection is severed on transient errors
    - Use 3rd party queue to persist the requests beyond a temporary failure.
      - Allows you to audit failing requests independently.
- **Retry pattern**
  - Cloud applications must be sensitive to transient faults.
    - E.g. loss of network connectivity, the temporary unavailability of a service, timeouts that arise when a service is busy.
  - They're typically self-correcting, if the action that triggered a fault is repeated after a suitable delay, it's likely to be successful.
    - DB with too many concurrent requests can have throttling (fails until workload is eased). Fixes itself after some delay.
  - Solution: Retry for temporarily fails.
    - Remote service => retry after short wait.
      - Fails again => Limit attempts to avoid brute forcing retry again until maximum tries are reached.
        - to spread requests from multiple instances of the application as evenly as possible.
- **Competing consumers pattern**
  - Sudden large number of requests may cause unpredictable workload.
  - Single consumer => risk of being flooded, or messaging system being overloaded.
  - Solution: asynchronous messaging with variable quantities of message producers and consumers
    - Business logic in the application is not blocked while the requests are being processed.
    - Handle fluctuating workloads => system can run multiple instances of the consumer service.
- **Cache-aside pattern**
  - Problem: Cached data consistency
    - A strategy is needed to ensure that the data is up-to-date & handle situations where the data in cache has become stale.
  - Solution: read-through and write-through caching
    - Cache-aside => Effectively loads data into the cache on demand if it's not already available in the cache.
      - Not in cache? Fetch & add it to cache, modifications on cache=> write to data store.
- **Sharding pattern**
  - Problem: hosting large volumes of data in a traditional singe-instance store
  - Some limitations
    - Storage space: Upgrading disks is not easy.
    - Computing resources: It's not possible to always increase more
    - Network bandwith: Network traffic might exceed
    - Geography: Reduce latency of data access for different across regions.
  - Scaling up can postpone affects but only temporary solution
  - Solution: partitioning data horizontally across many nodes
    - Divide data store into horizontal partitions, or shards.
    - Shard: Same schema but distinct subset of data.
    - Sharding can be in data access code, or storage system with transparent sharding
      - Abstracting physical location => High level of control over which shard contain which data.
        - Easier to migrate between shard without touching application logic.
        - Tradeoff => Additional data access overhead to determine the location of each data item as it's retrieved
    - For optimal performance & scalability
      - Split data in a way that's appropriate for the types of queries the application performs.
      - Sharding schema will exactly match requirements of every query.
      - E.g.:
        - In multitenant system => You lookup with tenant id + e.g. tenant's name, Tenant's name = sharding key

## Hybrid Networking

- **Site-to-site connectivity (Site-to-site VPN)**
  - Between your on-premises site <=> VNet in Azure via IPsec tunnel.
  - Resources on local network can communicate with resources on Azure VNet
    - No need for separate connection for each client computer in local network.
  - Requires VPN device.
  - E.g.:
    - IT Pros and Developer in-office have their own gateway and connect to Azure.
    - Q&A offshore team has its own gateway and connect to Azure
- **Point-to-site connectivity (Point-to-site VPN)**
  - Configured on each client computer that you want to connect to the VNet in Azure.
  - No need for VPN device
    - Instead you use VPN client you install on each client computer.
    - Requires manually starting connection from client, can have auto reset.
- **Combining site-to-site and point-to-site connectivity**
  - Q&A offshore team connects via VPN gateway (site-to-site VPN)
  - Developers & IT Pros at office connects via VPN gateway (site-to-site VPN)
  - Developers working from home connect via direct VPN (point-to-site VPN)
- **Combining ExpressRoute and site-to-site connectivity**
  - Reasons
    - Multiple branch offices, it's costly to purchase peering for every location.
    - Multiple networks within the enterprise
      - Connect one to Azure using Express route for higher-risk traffic.
      - For lower-risk traffic, use site-to-site VPN
    - Use site-to-site VPN as a failover link if ExpressRoute connection fails.
- **Virtual network to virtual network connectivity (VNET to VNET)**
  - Utilizes Azure VPN gateways to connect VNets in Azure over IPSec/IKE tunnels.
  - E.g.: you have following topology (topology=nodes connect to other network via links)
    - IT-pros/developers in office has VPN-to-VPN to _Azure East Asia_
    - Offshore QA team has VPN-to-VPN to _Azure West US_
    - You set VNet-to-VNet between _Azure East Asia_ and _Azure West US_
      - Then both team can access _Azure East Asia_ and _Azure West US_
- Connecting across cloud providers
  - For failover, backup or migration between providers.
  - Amazon Web Services (AWS) =>
    - Create EC2 VM with Openswan (VPN software)
    - Create gateway on the Azure VNet side using static routing.
    - Use gateway IP from Azure to configure Openswan for tunnel connection

## Storing in cloud

### Durability of data

- A transaction is set of operations.
  - Seek to achieve some or all ACID properties.
    - **Atomic**
      - A transaction is executed only once; all work completes or none does.
      - Why?
        - Operations in a transaction often share common intent or depend on each other.
        - Performing only subset => intent can be missed.
    - **Consistent**
      - A transaction preserves the consistency of data.
        - Performed on consistent state and leads to consistent state.
        - Typically, developers are responsible for maintaining consistency.
    - **Isolated**
      - Concurrent transactions behave as if each were the only transaction running in the system.
      - Some applications reduce isolation level for better throughput
        - High isolation => limits number of concurrent transactions
    - **Durable**
      - A transaction must be recoverable.
      - It must be persisted if e.g. computer crashes.
        - Special logging solves this.
  - In relational database systems (RDBMS) it's a single unit of work.
  - All-or-none => If it fails, DB is rolled back, all modification are erased.

### Caching

- Caching aims to improve performance & scalability of a system.
- It's done by temporarily copying frequently accessed data to a fast storage, close to application.
- Most effective when
  - Same data is repeatedly read.
  - Original data store =>
    - Relatively static
    - Slow compared to cache's speed
    - Subject to significant level of contention
      - Contention in DB systems =>
        - multiple processes or instances competing for access to the same index or data block at the same time
    - It's far away & network latency cause access to be slow.
- Distributed applications typically implement either or both when caching data:
  - **Private cache** : Locally held on computer that's running application.
    - ***In-memory store***: Accessed by single process.
      - Quick & affective, size is typically constrained to host machine.
    - ***Local file system***
      - Slower than in-memory, but faster than retrieving across network.
      - Each application holds its own copy of the data.
    - Problem:
      - Snapshot of the original data at a point of past.
        - Different application instance can hold different versions.
  - **Shared cache** : Common source which multiple processes/machines can access.
    - All instances see same view of data as opposed to in-memory.
    - It's highly scalable
      - Cache services uses cluster of servers and software for distribution.
      - Easy to scale by adding to / removing from a cluster.
    - Disadvantages:
      - Slower to access => Held locally to each application instance.
      - Implementing separate cache service => increases complexity.
- Caching considerations
  - When?
    - The more data you have, the larger number of users that need to access this data => minimum load on the original data store.
    - If original data store is unavailable, cache can be used.
  - How to cache data effectively?
    - Determine the post appropriate data to cache
    - Cache it at the appropriate time.
      - Add data to the cache on demand when it's retrieved first time.
      - Populate in advance
        - _Seeding:_ when the application start.
        - Not good for large cache as it can cause sudden high load.
  - Manage data expiration.
    - Cached data becomes stale after a while.
    - Expire caches so they're removed, and retrieved on next read.
    - Set a default policy, many cache services you can set period for individual objects while storing them programmatically.
- **Redis Cache**
  - Recommended by Azure, replaces Azure Cache (deprecated).
  - NoSQL key-value database.
    - Unique: Allows complex data structure for its keys.
  - SKU's: Basic (single node), Standard (2 nodes + SLA)

### Measuring throughput

- Normalized units
  - Relative performance guarantees by cloud vendors.
  - your application uses 20 units, 40 unit will give you appr. double performance.
- DTUs – Database throughput units (Azure SQL Database)
  - Based on compute, storage and IO.
  - DTU's for single databases, eDTUs for elastic pools.
  - Fixed per pricing plans, e.g.: Basic = 5 DTU, Standard 2 = 50 DTU
- RUs – Request unit processing per second (Azure Cosmos DB)
  - Each operation incurs a request charge, which is expressed in Rus.
    - Single request unit (normalized) => 1 read of 1 KB document.
    - Create, replace, delete consumes more processing = more request units.

### Structure of data

- Polyglot persistence => solutions that uses mix of data store technologies.
- Structured data stores
  - Most vendors use SQL.
  - Have RDMS (relational database management system)
    - Conforms to be ACID.
    - Supports schema-on-write
      - You define data structure, all read+write use same schema.
  - Hard to scale out.
  - g. Azure SQL Database, Azure Database for MySQL, Azure Database for Postgres
- Unstructured / semi-structured data stores
  - Doesn't use tabular schema of rows & columns.
  - Can store as key/value pairs, JSON documents, or as a graph (edges + vertices)
  - Have no relational model.
  - Graph databases => Cosmos DB, Gremlin API
    - Optimized for exploring weighted relationships between entities.
    - Stores edges (entities) and nodes (relationship between enodes).
  - Document databases => Azure Cosmos Db
  - NoSQL => Most systems supports SQL compatible queries, but non-SQL DB's.
  - Column family: HBase in HDInsights
    - Key-value pair, where key is mapped to a value that's a set of column.
  - Massively parallel & distributed solutions for ingesting, storing, and analyzing data
    - SQL Data Warehouse
    - Azure Data Lake
    - Time series data stores => Time Series Insights
      - ptimized for queries over time-based sequences of data, indexed by datetime.
  - Others: Object storage => Blob storage, Shared files => File storage
